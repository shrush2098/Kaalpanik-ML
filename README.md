This project aims to apply machine learning automation techniques to swimming pool data. Swimming pools represent significant energy savings opportunities in the residential and hospitality sector. Achieving power efficiency over a large number of swimming pools will significantly contribute to energy conservation that leads to a sustainable environment. 
The goal of the project is to apply Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques on IoT based Swimming Pool Automation Systems data to provide the user with usage statistics so that the user can effectively strategize energy consumption and cost planning to decrease power consumption and increase power efficiency. 
The Web App is primarily developed using the Flask web framework and bokeh framework to provide a user-friendly interface that includes interactive charts and graphs. The machine learning model is developed in the python language and makes use of crucial software machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras. 
The machine learning model gives the predictions with the accuracy. The web app draws the results from the ML model and displays this result to the user with the help of insightful charts and graphs
Ml models used  :
  1.Linear Regression
  2.Lasso Regression
  3.Ridge Regression
  4.Support Vector Regression(SVR)
  5.Autoregression Model (AR)
  6.Moving Average
  7.AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA)
  8.Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
